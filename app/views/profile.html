                My name is Hamza Arshad and I am currently in my 2B term studying Biomedical Engineering
                at the University of Waterloo. Despite my program of choice, I have a strong affinity for
                computer science and hardware. I love tinkering with new tech in my spare time, and for that
                very reason I enjoy learning new frameworks and languages in full-stack development. My dream
                is to eventually start my own SaaS company where I could service patients and clinicians in making
                medical treatment more efficient and secure.

            <div class="second-para">
                As of this moment, I am <span style="font-family: Metropolis-Semi-Bold">seeking employment for
                the Fall 2019 term</span>. In my previous endeavours, I have operated the whole stack, using
                legacy stacks such as WAMP/XAMP stacks, to transitioning into more contemporary web-based architecture,
                such as a Rails backend, a JS (React, Angular, D3) front-end, and a PostgreSQL server.
            </div>
            <div class="third-para">
                As for my future endeavours, I am open to all opportunities. I would love to learn new skills
                and be placed in a fast-paced environment where I can be challenged and create something of my own.
